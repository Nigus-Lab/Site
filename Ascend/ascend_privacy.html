      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>At Ascend, protecting your privacy is our highest priority. We understand that the data you create while managing your habits and tasks is personal and valuable. This Privacy Policy outlines exactly how Ascend handles the information generated within the app. We believe in full transparency and simplicity, ensuring users understand what data is processed, how it is used, and the measures we take to protect your privacy. By using Ascend, you acknowledge and accept the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Ascend is built to be private by design. Unlike many apps that require sign-ins or collect personal identifiers, Ascend operates entirely without personal account creation. We do not request or store personal information such as your name, email, or location. The app’s functionality is fully available without providing any data that could be used to identify you. Our commitment is to keep your digital life within your control, and we do not, under any circumstances, sell or share your information with third parties.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data generated by the app—including habits, tasks, check-ins, and reminders—is stored locally on your device. This design ensures that you are the sole custodian of your information. There is no cloud synchronization unless explicitly initiated by you through your device's backup services. Your data remains under your control at all times, and Ascend has no access to the information stored locally. For users seeking additional protection, device-level encryption and secure backups are strongly recommended.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Notifications & Reminders</h2>
        <p>Ascend allows you to schedule notifications and reminders to help maintain your daily habits and tasks. These notifications are entirely managed by your device, and Ascend does not track or log which notifications are sent or interacted with. You have full control over enabling or disabling notifications, and your privacy is never compromised through this feature.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Ascend incorporates Google AdMob to provide advertising content. AdMob may collect certain device information such as identifiers, IP addresses, and approximate location data to deliver personalized or non-personalized advertisements. Ascend itself does not share or transmit your personal information to any advertising partners. For further information on how your data is used by Google AdMob, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Ascend is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has inadvertently provided personal information within the app, they should contact us immediately so that we can remove the data. Protecting the privacy and safety of children is a top priority, and we adhere strictly to applicable laws regarding children’s online privacy.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since all data remains on your device, the security of your habits, tasks, and reminders is directly related to the security of your device itself. We recommend using device-level security features such as encryption, strong passwords, and secure backups to ensure your information remains safe. Ascend takes every precaution to prevent unauthorized access, but as with any software storing data locally, no absolute guarantee of security can be provided.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the app, legal requirements, or industry best practices. When changes occur, they will be clearly indicated within the app and this page. Users are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about how Ascend protects their privacy. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>User Rights</h2>
        <p>Even though Ascend does not collect personal data, you have full control over the information stored locally. You can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Delete all tasks and habits at any time.</li>
          <li>Disable notifications or reminders as you wish.</li>
          <li>Manage device-level backups to retain or erase your local data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your rights ensure that you are never required to relinquish control of your data to use the app.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy or the app’s functionality, you are welcome to contact us directly:</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Notes</h2>
        <p>By using Ascend, you acknowledge that your data is stored locally, you have complete control over it, and that third-party integrations like AdMob may process limited non-personal information for ad delivery. We encourage users to keep their devices secure and remain informed about privacy best practices. Ascend is committed to maintaining transparency and providing a safe, private, and helpful experience for all users.</p>
